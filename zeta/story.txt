new idea ...
'metroid' (sci fi) meets 'castlevania' (medieval) ... 
set in modern times


	- see people turning into mindless violent zombies
	- find out about broadcasts overriding human senses.  "They Live!"
level 1: tv station. los angeles.
	find people controlled by invisible (predator-style cloaking) 9 ft tall lizards 
	midway boss, you fight one of these lizards 
	fight to the top of the building, blow up the big antennae.  just like the movie. boss fight is helecopter.  just like the movie.
	then the lizard people are revealed.  but everyone is still too apathetic and stupid.  they don't care.
	from there you read docs: "they weren't just using cloaks and radio waves, they were also mass-drugging the population!"
level 2: water treatment facility. los angeles again.
	stop them from poisoning the water!
	flouridation.  "vital life fluids" quote for dr. strangelove.
	from there learn they are getting the air as well ... (source: nasa papers on lithium particulate spraying, los alamos papers on aluminum particulate spraying)
	follow a supply truck back to find 
level 3: unlisted airbase with unmarked planes.  los angeles.
	stop the spraying of stuff on the populations.
	find some underground high speed rail to take you to a military base
level 4: deep underground military base.  outskirst of los angeles.
	arrive, look at schematics, see genetic experiments, go down and stop them. 
	let some human test subjects free.
	midpoint boss:  fight some genetic super mutant "with chemical kill switch" (source: darpa rfp for making such creatures, and their excuse: "because the russians and chinese are already working on this")
	find the 'thermal disaggregation' high speed laser drill (cite patent?)
	fight either that, or some other monster in the caves ...
	ride the rail system, come across a bump in the road
	find an entrance to an underground civilization ...
level 5: underground alien civilization.  arizona.
	aliens that shoot lasers at you by waving their hands in front of their chest (source: phil schneider's description).
	have some lost cities of gold, advanced technology, holograms, etc ... (source: grand canyon city legends / hopi legends of reptilians under los angeles / windmakers legends)
level 6: mt graham, lucifer telescope
	come up to the surface
	find yourself at mt graham (source: all the weird tall creatures sighted climbing the mountain ... was it mt graham or another mountain?)
	go next door to the vatican's 'lucifer' telescope.  blow it up.
(TODO this could be a great reason to transition next to the vatican and its underground city. maybe go here after dulce base and the underground rail is finished.) 
	continue on the fast train ...
level 7: dulce base
(TODO seems this base could be merged with the first base ... but where would the detour to mt graham fit in?)
	find a tr-3b parked at unlisted the air base.
	"next on the list, gotta take down that weaponized satellite defense laser system..." (source: darpa, again, for their plans to put a giant 25-mile-wide solar panel into orbit, with intentions to 'beam wireless energy' to the surface, and options to 'weaponize' the technology)
	push the autopilot.
	goes back to antarctica.
level 6: antarctica. mt. erebus, (to reference the doom videogame)
	fight off fallen cherubim with bull heads bipedal calf feet.  (reference: doom, ezekiel 1, 'devil of devonshire', etc)
	fight off some aliens or something.  idk.
	finally get around to the satellite system.
level 7: finally get to earth orbit, satellites for defense system, etc
	take down satellite defense system.
	somewhere in there
	learn of secret worldwide domination plans.  to use money to enslave humanity.
		to open a portal to hell using cern.
		decide to take out two birds with one stone
level 8: crash land the satellite into cern or something
	interrupt right as the countdown to turn on the hell portal in cern was at '1'
	fight some miniboss
	"you're too late!" and the bad guy flips the switch
	the devil walks through the portal, everyone falls for him, he tells them he destroys everyone who doesn't follow him
	and points you out, and everyone goes after you.
	final boss fight: kill the devil, defend the pepole trying to defeat you, save humanity

other level options:
	- vatican, and the buildings under it.
	- giza. bosses: pharaoh? some egyptian mutant false-god- anubus, sphynx, etc?
	- cozco / nazca lines.  bosses: conehead skull guys who stand 9ft tall.  a conehead skull guy would be a great boss.
	- atlantis / lemuria / mu.  bosses: sea people.
	- phobos, deimos, far side of moon, moon of saturn, etc ... orion ...
