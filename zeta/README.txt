TODO list

- editor: move texpack tiles and change map tiles accordingly
- object classes use 'spawnfields' for editor fields, types, and tooltips
- missile launcher missile ammo
- link objs and spawninfos to rooms, respawn by room
- camera align via room info, or helper objects
- fix collisions with sloped tiles.  determine ymin and ymax on the x side of sloped tiles and test that against object bbox. 
- make deactivated turrets shoot at enemies.  do room links first to cut down on game.objs iterations.
- geemers and doors donâ€™t mix.  one pushes the other and the geemer teleports.
- second kind of defense monster: heat shields or something
- second kind of cave monster ... bats or something? or separate ground from wall geemers?
- spawn more monsters in the mining base area *after* beating the boss
- room environmental effects ... foreground warping (underwater, heat), blowing wind, falling snow/rain/leaves, etc
- get savepoint loading to work

VETOED list:
- don't use 'spawnclass' as a class shortcut to register classes that are spawned.
	to execute the spawn code, all the class will have to be require()'d somewhere in one spot anyways
	it's better to list the names in 'spawnTypes' than have everything being required
- don't separating playerLook vs canCarry.  set an item down by a terminal, and try to pick it up again.
	- using 'a' for run and use item means ... you can't run / always run when using an item 
	solution? get rid of carrying items altogether? options:
		- carrying items (spelunky)
		- touch to get (metroid)
		- push 'interact' button to to pick up (cave story)
	item overhaul:
		- touch/interaact to pick everything up -- no carrying
		- left/right switches weapons only.  one weapon is 'throw grenades' -- only if you have grenades.
		- canCarry only operates with a powerup: carry gloves, used for story stuff
		- separate inventory screen for using non-weapon objects
			(this means no more 'take the keycard out to open the door')

buttons:
	- up/down to aim, left/right to move
	- L/R: weapon prev/next (shift+L/R for inv prev/next? or too confusing?  separate L2&R2 for inv prev/next?  or too many buttons?)

	- B: jump
	- Y: shoot
	- A: use selected aux item.  
		- for weapons/armor: this equips it.
		- for aux things like grappling hook, speed booster, jetpack, pick-up gloves, etc, this uses it.
	- X: go to inventory, where arrows select and B uses the item.  
		using items involves:
			- one-time use items (reserve, powerup, etc)
			- activating/deactivating items (powerup suits, high-jump, etc)
			- selecting current aux item (grappling hook, speed booster, jetpack, pick-up gloves, etc)
