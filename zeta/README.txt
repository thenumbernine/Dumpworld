TODO list

- go ahead and put ext & vec on global namespace.  they're probably already there.
- editor: 
	- move texpack tiles and change map tiles accordingly
	- separate 'object' into 'create object' and 'select object'
	- click-and-drag on tile selection to form rectangles for brush + stamp size?
	- separate fields for numbers and strings
	- toggle editor for strings and multi-line strings (maybe a popup button?)
	- for editing vec2's, show as a point or as a vector .. maybe even click and drag to change? helped by obj ctor arg tips?
	- for vec4's ... show as a box2? toggle-able, like vectors?
	- object classes use 'spawnfields' for editor fields, types, and tooltips
- environmental effects ... foreground warping (underwater, heat), blowing wind, falling snow/rain/leaves, etc
- get savepoint loading to work
- missile launcher missile ammo
- environment for level/init.lua and for sandboxes
collision v1:
	- fix collisions with sloped tiles.  determine ymin and ymax on the x side of sloped tiles and test that against object bbox. 
collision v2:
	- player can still duck and jump on the top of a ladder with solid above and get halfway stuck in the ceiling
	- duck then stand up with a monster on your head.  you get stuck in the monster.
	- get slopes working
	- jump near a wall and shoot. your jump will stop midair. 
	- grenades still don't bounce on doors
	- movement still needs pushPriority implementation 
	- jumping on stacks of items still make the player float in the air.  too many stuck collision tests?
	- make sure there aren't any more physics slowdowns
	- give geemers their own solid type.  geemers are blocked by 'world' and 'yes'.  geemers touch 'yes'.  geemers were 'no', so any old 'no' touches that aim for geemers now need to add geemers.
		- or make a flag to not collide with your own class (that most monsters may be using)
		- or make a solid_monster that doesn't collide with other solid_monsters, that acts like above described.
	- sometimes grenades will hit a turret and ... not explode

monsters:
	- barriers only hit players if player is moving
	- sawblades only hit geemers if geemers are moving
	- geemers and doors donâ€™t mix.  one pushes the other and the geemer teleports.
	- moar mining base monsters:
		- flying drones ...
		- other evil robots like you
	- moar cave monsters.  
		- venus fly traps
		- close-range guy
		- things that fly back and forth maybe
		- maybe some kind of shooter

rooms
	- fixed? 16x16? 24x24? 32x32?
	- arbitrary?

VETOED list:
- screen base spawning
	- first i tried spawn and remove based on spawninfo.  enemies would disappear if they walked too far from their start.
	- then i did spawn by spawninfo, remove by object.  if you lure an enemy too far from their home to kill them, they reappear.  this is frustrating. 
	- finally i'm going back to metroid/castlevania/cavestory-styled rooms 
- don't use 'spawnclass' as a class shortcut to register classes that are spawned.
	to execute the spawn code, all the class will have to be require()'d somewhere in one spot anyways
	it's better to list the names in 'spawnTypes' than have everything being required
- don't separating playerLook vs canCarry.  set an item down by a terminal, and try to pick it up again.
	item system options:
		- carrying items (spelunky / current system)
			pros:
			- most flexible
			cons:
			- using 'a' for run and use item means ... you can't run / always run when using an item 
			- need terminal/savepoint button *and* object button, or else objects can get stuck if you put them down by terminals
				- for the record, spelunky was like this too.  one button for items, up for doors
			- item order is never the same (can be fixed)
			- have to have your hands empty to pick something up
			- when you pick something up, it switches your inventory
		- touch to get (metroid)
			pros:
			- most simple
			cons:
			- no easy way to switch between and use individual items
			- need a distinct weapon for throwing objects
		- push 'interact' button to to pick up (cave story)
			- just like metroid style, but with an extra button to get things
	item overhaul:
		- touch/interaact to pick everything up -- no carrying
		- left/right switches weapons only.  one weapon is 'throw grenades' -- only if you have grenades.
		- canCarry only operates with a powerup: carry gloves, used for story stuff
		- separate inventory screen for using non-weapon objects
			(this means no more 'take the keycard out to open the door')

buttons:
	- up/down to aim, left/right to move
	- L/R: weapon prev/next (shift+L/R for inv prev/next? or too confusing?  separate L2&R2 for inv prev/next?  or too many buttons?)

	- B: jump
	- Y: shoot
	- A: use selected aux item.  
		- for weapons/armor: this equips it.
		- for aux things like grappling hook, speed booster, jetpack, pick-up gloves, etc, this uses it.
	- X: go to inventory, where arrows select and B uses the item.  
		using items involves:
			- one-time use items (reserve, powerup, etc)
			- activating/deactivating items (powerup suits, high-jump, etc)
			- selecting current aux item (grappling hook, speed booster, jetpack, pick-up gloves, etc)
