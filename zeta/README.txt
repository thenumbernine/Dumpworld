TODO list

- editor: 
	- move texpack tiles and change map tiles accordingly
	- separate 'object' into 'create object' and 'select object'
- object classes use 'spawnfields' for editor fields, types, and tooltips
- camera align via room info, or helper objects
- fix collisions with sloped tiles.  determine ymin and ymax on the x side of sloped tiles and test that against object bbox. 
- make deactivated turrets shoot at enemies.  do room links first to cut down on game.objs iterations.
- geemers and doors donâ€™t mix.  one pushes the other and the geemer teleports.
- second kind of cave monster ... bats or something? or separate ground from wall geemers?
- environmental effects ... foreground warping (underwater, heat), blowing wind, falling snow/rain/leaves, etc
- get savepoint loading to work
weapons:
	- missile launcher missile ammo
	- number-based rather than index-based ... and overhaul the item system
rooms:
	- every time an item is grabbed, set a session var that says the item at this level at this index is grabbed
		then have the respawn system ignore it if that var is set
		(serialize those session vars with the save file)
	- same with the electric fields and 'toggleDisabled'
	in fact, for both, why not just serialize all objects as they leave?
	upon removing room spawns, serialize objects and store them in a session/cache file
		then upon adding room spawns, create the objs, then check the cache and overwrite values
		then double the caching system as the savegame system
	- if an *object* leaves your neighborhood then remove it 
	 	but if a *spawninfo* enters into your neighborhood (and it has no current object bound) then add it 
		... but items would need all their positions updated to keep alive
		... or get rid of items-as-objects completely - replace with items-as-values
	- touch triggers don't get along with room system?
	
VETOED list:
- screen base spawning
	- first i tried spawn and remove based on spawninfo.  enemies would disappear if they walked too far from their start.
	- then i did spawn by spawninfo, remove by object.  if you lure an enemy too far from their home to kill them, they reappear.  this is frustrating. 
	- finally i'm going back to metroid/castlevania/cavestory-styled rooms 
- don't use 'spawnclass' as a class shortcut to register classes that are spawned.
	to execute the spawn code, all the class will have to be require()'d somewhere in one spot anyways
	it's better to list the names in 'spawnTypes' than have everything being required
- don't separating playerLook vs canCarry.  set an item down by a terminal, and try to pick it up again.
	item system options:
		- carrying items (spelunky / current system)
			pros:
			- most flexible
			cons:
			- using 'a' for run and use item means ... you can't run / always run when using an item 
			- need terminal/savepoint button *and* object button, or else objects can get stuck if you put them down by terminals
			- item order is never the same (can be fixed)
			- have to have your hands empty to pick something up
			- when you pick something up, it switches your inventory
		- touch to get (metroid)
			pros:
			- most simple
			cons:
			- no easy way to switch between and use individual items
			- need a distinct weapon for throwing objects
		- push 'interact' button to to pick up (cave story)
			- just like metroid style, but with an extra button to get things
	item overhaul:
		- touch/interaact to pick everything up -- no carrying
		- left/right switches weapons only.  one weapon is 'throw grenades' -- only if you have grenades.
		- canCarry only operates with a powerup: carry gloves, used for story stuff
		- separate inventory screen for using non-weapon objects
			(this means no more 'take the keycard out to open the door')

buttons:
	- up/down to aim, left/right to move
	- L/R: weapon prev/next (shift+L/R for inv prev/next? or too confusing?  separate L2&R2 for inv prev/next?  or too many buttons?)

	- B: jump
	- Y: shoot
	- A: use selected aux item.  
		- for weapons/armor: this equips it.
		- for aux things like grappling hook, speed booster, jetpack, pick-up gloves, etc, this uses it.
	- X: go to inventory, where arrows select and B uses the item.  
		using items involves:
			- one-time use items (reserve, powerup, etc)
			- activating/deactivating items (powerup suits, high-jump, etc)
			- selecting current aux item (grappling hook, speed booster, jetpack, pick-up gloves, etc)
